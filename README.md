# Ecommerce with MERN stack
This is the code for (Arabic) educational course on aseeu.org to teach MERN stack
This website is built with React js to build the front-end, Nodejs (express) in the backend and mongodb for database to get a fully functional E-commerce web application
Unfortunately, Heroku has no free tier subscription anymore, so to deploy into production you need to have a paid subscription in Heroku

## Collaboration
If you know a different way for deploying a production version MERN stack for free, contact me on aseeu.2010@gmail.com
and i will update the course with this info
